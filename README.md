# CTA-Ridership-Data
This is a short exercise (2-3 hrs of work) using the data on the number of people that go through the turnstiles at every Chicago "L" station since 2001. 

# Challenge
Please choose a specific business and tell us which business you chose; any kind of business will do. 

Imagine youâ€™re helping that business owner in Chicago and s/he is looking to open a new location. 

In the form of writing, potentially supplemented by sketches (computer-drawn or hand-drawn) and links, we want to see your response to these questions:

> What questions could you potentially explore/answer with this data?

> Ideally, what other data would you gather or combine to learn even more?

> How would you want to see data presented, to make it actionable by you or others?

> How could an algorithm or model be used? How might your client interact with that algorithm or model?
